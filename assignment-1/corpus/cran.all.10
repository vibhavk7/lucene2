the interaction of a reflected shock wave with the
boundary layer in a shock tube .
  ideally, the reflection of a shock
from the closed end of a shock
tube provides, for laboratory study,
a quantity of stationary gas at
extremely high temperature .  because
of the action of viscosity, however,
the flow in the real case is not
one-dimensional, and a boundary layer
grows in the fluid following the initial shock wave .
  in this paper simplifying assumptions
are made to allow an analysis
of the interaction of the shock reflected
from the closed end with the
boundary layer of the initial shock
afterflow .  the analysis predicts
that interactions of several different
types will exist in different
ranges of initial shock mach number .
it is shown that the cooling
effect of the wall on the afterflow
boundary layer accounts for the change
in interaction type .
  an experiment is carried out which
verifies the existence of the
several interaction regions and shows
that they are satisfactorily
predicted by the theory .  along with these
results, sufficient information
is obtained from the experiments to make
possible a model for the
interaction in the most complicated case .
this model is further verified
by measurements made during the experiment .
  the case of interaction with a
turbulent boundary layer is also
considered .  identifying the type of
interaction with the state of
turbulence of the interacting boundary
layer allows for an estimate of the
state of turbulence of the boundary
layer based on an experimental
investigation of the type of interaction .

a low density wind tunnel study of shock wave structure
and relaxation phenomena in gases .
  the profiles and thicknesses
of normal shock waves of moderate
strength have been determined
experimentally in terms of the variation
of the equilibrium temperature
of an insulated transverse cylinder in
free-molecule flow .  the shock
waves were produced in a steady state in
the jet of a low-density wind
tunnel, at initial mach numbers of 1.72
and 1.82 in helium and 1.78,
the shock thickness, determined
from the maximum slope of the cylinder
temperature profile, varied from
mean free path in the supersonic
stream .  a comparison between the
experimental shock profiles and various
theoretical predictions leads to the
tentative conclusions that ..  (1)
the navier-stokes equations are adequate
for the description of the shock
transition for initial mach numbers up
to 2, and (2) the effects of
rotational relaxation times in air can be
accounted for by the introduction
of a /second/ or /bulk/ viscosity
coefficient equal to about two-thirds
of the ordinary shear viscosity .

some aerodynamic considerations of nozzle afterbody
combination .
  the aerodynamic problems associated with
propulsion-system installations have assumed a role
of vital importance in the development of supersonic
aircraft .  although air-induction systems have received
moderate attention in the literature, considerably less
information can be found on the design and installation
of turbojet exit nozzles .  this condition should not be
interpreted to indicate a lack of problems in jet-exit
design .
  as flight speeds reach supersonic levels, it becomes
increasingly difficult to achieve nozzle installations
which are efficient over the entire speed range .  the
difficulties largely stem from the fact that the goals of
high jet thrust and low afterbody drag are not always
compatible .  in many of the compromise solutions, it
is generally unsatisfactory to examine isolated nozzle
and afterbody performance .  rather they must be
treated as a unit, and the complex effects of jet
interaction with the external stream must be taken into
account .  to accomplish this, the nozzle and air-frame
designers must closely coordinate their efforts .
  some of the aerodynamic problems of nozzle
afterbody combinations are outlined in this report .
particular attention is devoted to the influence of the
jet-stream interaction on both nozzle thrust and
after-body drag .  for this purpose, use is made of shock-
boundary-layer-interaction concepts .  this approach,
although not precise, correctly predicts many trends
and is generally enlightening .

the effect of a central jet on the base pressure of
a cylindrical afterbody in a supersonic stream .
  this report describes an experimental investigation
of the factors affecting the base flow and
jet structure behind a cylindrical after-body with a central nozzle .
seven interchangeable nozzles were tested .
six of these were convergent-divergent, with a design mach
number of 2.0, jet base diameter ratios ranging
from 0.2 to 0.8 and nozzle divergence angles ranging from
convergent with a jet base diameter ratio of 0.6 .
  in the main experimental programme the free-stream
mach number was 2.0 and the boundary layer was
turbulent both on the after-body and in the nozzle .
measurements were made of the base pressure, the surface
pressure distribution inside the nozzle, the overall thrust
and the nozzle mass flow, over a range of jet pressures .
this programme was supplemented by comparative
tests with the jet exhausting into still air (static tests) .
readings were taken of the internal nozzle pressures
and the jet thrust at different jet pressures .  schlieren
photography was used extensively throughout .
  the results of the tests with external flow are
presented in the form of curves showing the separate effects
of jet pressure ratio, jet base diameter ratio, nozzle
design mach number and nozzle divergence angle on the
base pressure and overall thrust .  the special case
of base bleed is discussed separately .  similar curves are
included for the static tests .  these show the effect
of jet pressure ratio and nozzle geometry on the jet thrust .
  a general method of correlating data on annular
base pressures is proposed and discussed .  essentially, this
method compares the pressure on an annular
base with the calculated pressure on the corresponding
two-dimensional base .  it correlates the present
results reasonably well, but is less successful when applied
to more extensive data .

investigation at supersonic speeds of the effects of
jet mach number and divergence angle of the nozzle
upon the pressure of the base annulus of a body of

  an investigation has been conducted
in the langley 9-inch supersonic
tunnel to determine the jet effects for
varying jet mach number and
nozzle divergence angle upon the pressure
on the base annulus of a model with
a cylindrical afterbody .  the tests
were conducted over a wide range of
jet static pressure ratios and at a
reynolds number of approximately
free-stream mach numbers of 1.62, 1.94,
and 2.41 .  all testing was conducted
with an artificially induced
turbulent boundary layer along the model .
  in the lower range of jet static
pressure ratios, jet flow from a
sonic or supersonic nozzle affected
the pressure acting on the base
annulus in essentially the same manner
as shown in naca rm e53h25 which covers
jet static pressure ratios up to about
present results showed that the base
pressure tends to level off with
increasing jet static pressure ratio,
and at the extreme static pressure
ratios reached in tests with sonic
nozzles the base pressure began to
decrease .  except in the lower range
of jet static pressure ratios,
nozzle divergence angle generally had a
larger effect on the base pressures
than nozzle mach number,. the increase
in base pressure for a change in
divergence angle from 0 to 10 was
small compared to the increase when
the divergence angle was changed from
and other data indicates that the effects
of divergence angle were reduced
when the ratio of jet exit diameter to base
diameter was decreased .  jet
mach number effects increased with increase in stream mach number .

base pressure at subsonic speeds in the presence of
a supersonic jet .
  this paper presents the results of an experimental investigation
into the effect of supersonic jets upon the base pressure of a bluff
cylinder in a uniform subsonic flow .  the ratio of jet diameter to base
diameter was 0.1875 .
  jet stagnation pressures giving slight under-expansion of the jet
cause an increase in the base pressure but for larger jet stagnation
pressures the base pressure is again reduced .
  a simple theory, based on a momentum integral, shows the dependence
of the base drag upon the jet and free stream speeds and upon the
dimensions of the jet and the base .

the mixing of free axially-symmetrical jets of mach number 1.40 .
axially-symmetrical, supersonic, fully-expanded jets of diameter
about 0.75 in. and of mach number 1.40 issuing into an atmosphere
at rest were investigated by schlieren and shadow photography and
by pressure traversing .  the development of the jets was found to
depend critically on the strength of the shock waves in the core of the
jet at the nozzle exit .  with strong shock waves present the jet spread
very rapidly and was very unsteady .  the jet did in some cases break up
into large eddies of the same size as the diameter of the jet .  when
no disturbances were present in the core of the jet the spreading
was far more gradual and the jet showed only slight unsteadiness .
the turbulent mixing region of the first part of the jet with strong
shock waves was investigated in detail by pitot tubes .  the first
inch was found to correspond to a two-dimensional half-jet .  the
velocity profiles were similar and well represented by the error
integral .  the rate of spreading was only half the value for
low-speed flow .  by integrations across the mixing region the
entrainment and the loss of kinetic energy were determined .
these quantities were found to agree well with the values estimated by
assuming an error-integral velocity profile .

an analysis of base pressure at supersonic speeds and
comparison with experiment .
  in the first part of the
investigation an analysis is made of base
pressure in an inviscid fluid,
both for two-dimensional and
axially-symmetric flow .  it is shown that
for two-dimensional flow, and also for
the flow over a body of revolution
with a cylindrical sting attached to
the base, there are an infinite
number of possible solutions satisfying
all necessary boundary conditions
at any given free-stream mach number .
for the particular case of a body
having no sting attached only one
solution is possible in an inviscid
flow, but it corresponds to zero
base drag .  accordingly, it is concluded
that a strictly inviscid-fluid
theory cannot be satisfactory for practical applications .
  since the exact inviscid-fluid
theory does not adequately describe
the conditions of a real fluid flow,
an approximate semi-empirical theory
for base pressure in a viscous fluid
is developed in a second part of the
investigation .  the semi-empirical
theory is based partly on
inviscid-flow calculations, and is restricted
to airfoils and bodies without
boat-tailing .  in this theory an attempt
is made to allow for the effects of
mach number, reynolds number, profile
shape, and type of boundary-layer
flow .  the results of some recent
experimental measurements of base
pressure in two-dimensional and
axially-symmetric flow are presented for
purposes of comparison .  some
experimental results also are presented
concerning the support interference
effect of a cylindrical sting, and
the interference effect of a reflected
bow wave on measurements of base
pressure in a supersonic wind tunnel .
